The user experience consists of moving the arrow keys or moving the 
user's face in various directions. The design is oriented around the 
theme of forcing the user to do physical exercise. This is done by the face
detection feature which moves the character based on the movement of the 
user's face. This design decision was made to create a fun user experience 
and provide a unique way to interact with the game pieces.
